# Machine Learning Model for the Lunar Albedo

NASA's Lunar Prospector orbited the Moon for almost 19 months to map its surface composition and to look for polar ice. The probe found evidence suggesting water ice at both poles. The mission ended with the spacecraft impacting the lunar surface, creating a dust cloud that was studied from Earth.

Planetary surfaces are observed as all electromagnetic wavelengths (e.g. radar, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray), and each wavelength provides unique information about the chemistry, mineralogy, and history of the surface. Yet the information is not entirely independent. For example, the chemical element iron, which is mapped with x-rays and gamma rays, is highly related to optical albedo on the Moon. Knowing this, we can develop high-spatial resolution predictive maps of iron-based on optical data.

The goal of the project is to use machine learning techniques to identify relationships between lunar mapped datasets, with the goal of providing a deeper understanding of lunar surfaces and to have predictive power for lunar surfaces.
